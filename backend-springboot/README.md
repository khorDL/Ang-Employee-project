ðŸ”¹ Priority 1: Essential and Common in Real-World Projects
Feature	Why It's Priority
âœ… Exposing APIs properly (versioning, error handling, pagination)	Ensures your backend is ready for real use.
âœ… Spring Boot REST Docs / Swagger OpenAPI (API Documentation)	Makes your API discoverable and testable.
âœ… Email / Push Notifications / SMS	Very common in production apps (e.g., verification, updates).
âœ… Authentication + Authorization (OAuth2 / JWT)	Required for almost all modern apps.
âœ… Third-party API integration (e.g., payment, weather)	Teaches handling external services (timeout, errors).

ðŸ”¹ Priority 2: For Scalability, Real-Time, and Modern Use Cases
Feature	Why It's Priority
âœ… WebSocket (Spring + Angular)	Enables real-time features like live chat or dashboard updates.
âœ… Message Queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka)	Decouple logic and improve scalability.
âœ… NoSQL integration (e.g., MongoDB, Redis)	Useful for caching or flexible document structures.

ðŸ”¹ Priority 3: Bonus & Interesting Tech Explorations
Feature	Why It's Cool
âœ… Cloud storage (AWS S3, Firebase Storage)	For file uploads like images, videos.
âœ… Generate PDF / Excel / Docs (e.g., iText, Apache POI)	For reports, invoices.
âœ… Stream/Process audio-video (e.g., FFmpeg, OpenCV, AWS Transcribe)	Advanced media use cases.
âœ… Graph algorithms (Spring + Neo4j / JGraphT)	Great for social networks, recommendations.
âœ… AI Integration (OpenAI, HuggingFace)	Adds smart features like summarization or image detection.

ðŸ§  Suggested Learning Order (Condensed):
âœ… Secure your API (JWT/OAuth2)

âœ… Expose and document your API (Swagger + REST conventions)

âœ… Integrate email/SMS/push

âœ… Use WebSocket (live updates)

âœ… Try third-party APIs (e.g., Stripe, weather)

âœ… Add Redis/MongoDB for performance or flexibility

âœ… Use RabbitMQ/Kafka for async processing

âœ… Try file upload + cloud storage (S3/Firebase)

âœ… Generate PDF/Excel

âœ… Add real-time video/audio streaming

âœ… Play with AI or graph structures
